                    <p>It's not just about getting to your destination, it's about experiencing all in the between.
                        Something that I point out oftenly as journeys get enriched by the stories written along the
                        way. Once that sentence gets wired into your brain you try implementing it in every situation
                        you can. One evening on a mid april's day the late hour tranquility got interrupted by an
                        incoming call. It was a friend of mine who mentioned that two of our friends opened up a bar
                        on the Croatian coast and proposed a trip to their location to pay them a visit. It is a trip that
                        lasts four to five hours, depending on the highway traffic. But we are not fans of highways.
                        We prefer roads that give you the feeling of exploration with each passing corner, roads with
                        a story to tell. A decision was made to go for it but with a bit longer route in mind.
                        Ignition key inserted and turned half-way. A buzzing sound appeared. It was the fuel pump
                        prepping the car's life lines. After that, soundwaves started exiting through the tip of the
                        aftermarket exhaust system, bounced from the garage walls and were making their way to
                        neighbouring houses. ˝It's ok,˝ I said to myself, ˝they are probably used to it by now.˝ But my
                        guess is that they still don't like it, especially at 6 o'clock in the morning so no time was to
                        spare. First gear selected and a minimum rev start followed. It was a calm, sunray filled
                        Sunday. The roads were empty. For a while it was just me and my classic Rover mini
                        heading to the capital. It takes little over an hour to get from Jesenice to Ljubljana without a
                        highway vignette. It is a road that was a great warm up for the roads to come.

                    <p>
                        In Ljubljana I met up with my friend whose Austin Mini clubman estate was proudly showing its fresh black paint
                        and was eagerly awaiting for us to embark on our journey. But where were we heading anyway? Our destination for
                        the first day was a city called Jajce which is situated in Bosnia. It's about 250 miles
                        away. Along the way there are many interesting places to visit and many delights to
                        try out, first of which was the regional road that was taking us to Croatia. It goes through
                        quaint villages, forests and twists itself around the highway for a while. We miss out on so
                        much while saving time on the dual carriageways. Crossed the Slovene-Croatian border at
                        Metlika and reached Karlovac where we took our first intentional break at the open air war
                        museum. Thick armor steel shaped into tanks, personnel carriers, artillery and lightweight
                        aluminum into helicopters and fighter planes. These are reminders left from Croatia's war for
                        independence, one of the 90's Yugoslav Wars which tore the former republic apart. A short
                        drive further brought us to our next point of interest - Rastoke. It's a milling settlement some
                        300 years old that was constructed next to gorgeous waterfalls and rapids, a place where
                        nature showed its playful and artistic side. The Korana river connects it to the famous
                        Plitvice lakes and is for that reason also known as ˝the small lakes of Plitvice.˝ A few pictures
                        taken, a few cups emptied and quite a few wheel rotations made and we ended up
                        overlooking the Bosnian border but wouldn't cross it just yet as a historic gem is hidden near
                        it. Object 505 or better known as airfield Željava. It is a military airfield hidden within a
                        mountain. It was built in secrecy between 1948 and 1968 and is known as Yugoslavia's most
                        expensive project. Exchanged the main road for a side road, passed the last few houses
                        there and the first thing that indicates that you are near an abandoned airfield appeared. A
                        Douglas DC-3 Dakota. At least what was left of it. The road then transformed into one of the
                        runways and took us to the nearest entrance to the underground base named Klek. 2 miles
                        of tunnels, space for 57 MIG's and over 3000 people, a hospital, educational, service and
                        operational centres, numerous warehouses and at the moment pitch darkness and massive
                        echoes. In May 1992, at the outbreak of war in Bosnia the base got heavily damaged with
                        more than 50 tonnes of explosives used. The passing time didn't help it either but the area is
                        still very interesting to explore.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once back outside, a longer look at the runway might persuade you for a high speed run.
                        Keep in mind though, it is located on the border itself. Crossing it at high speed might grab
                        the attention of a nearby police patrol vehicle, especially if you do it a few times. But
                        something tells me that they are used to that and will just leave you with a warning. We later
                        returned to the main road, (legally) crossed the border and headed onwards to our
                        destination. A few more cities passed and the E761 got us to a vast countryside where its
                        kinks got ironed out quite nicely. Slower traffic was no longer a problem and was easily left in
                        our dust as the oncoming vehicles could be spotted miles in advance.
                    </p>
                    <img id="" src={Jajce} alt="" className="fl pa2 br4 w-30"/>
                    <p>
                        Jajce is a city that has always been situated on important intersections on which trading routes,
                        nationalities, cultures and even rivers meet. It's a city that is attracting visitors with its 
                        natural beauties and its history. Since it was built in the 14th century the ruling hand
                        changed quite a few times. That is a story that starts unfolding
                        once you enter the city centre through its defensive walls and progresses when you make
                        your way uphill to the fortress, which is besides the 55 feet tall waterfall that connects the
                        river Pliva to the river Vrbas and the old water mills constructed in between the Pliva lakes
                        one of the biggest visitor magnets in the area. Once we waved goodbye to this lovely city we
                        set our sights towards the bosnian capital. A few hours of driving got us to Sarajevo. While
                        entering it you end up on the main, multi-lane road that is taking you to the centre. It is a city
                        that clearly had its fair share of historic events, reminders of which can be seen around the
                        city as monuments with inscriptions under it or as bullet holes and shell explosion effects still
                        visible on pavements and on some of the buildings. During the 90's war this became the
                        longest besieged city in history. After finding a parking spot and closing the car doors you
                        will start to get the feel of the city's spirit. A lively atmosphere with a relaxed vibe. Hard to
                        describe but it can be felt in the people, their attitude and in the looks of the city. While
                        strolling around you will pass by ottoman, austro-hungarian, yugoslav and modern
                        architecture and will sooner or later end up in the cultural centre which dates back to the
                        15th century - Baščaršija. A place where you cannot be on a diet. Having a taste of ćevapi, a
                        grilled minced meat national dish is an unwritten rule when visiting Sarajevo as well as trying
                        out some of the traditional desserts right afterwards. Be prepared to loosen your belt by a
                        notch or two after this trip as for a food lover this place is a little piece of heaven. When a
                        desire to mix in some natural beauty photos amongst architectural and foodie ones into the
                        album kicks in a trip to the outskirts is a great idea. Polish your landscape photography skills
                        from mt. Jahorina, your long exposure shots on the spring of river Bosna and take your
                        cityscape shots from mt. Trebević, where the photogenic leftovers from the 1984 Olympic
                        Winter Games will appear oftenly in your camera's viewfinder.

                    <p>
                        Leaving the capital. This is when we met with the E73, a road I have driven on a few times
                        before but one that never ceases to amaze me. It winds its way south through beautiful
                        valleys, carved by a mighty river and takes you to the Adriatic sea. It has many places on its
                        route that, if not missed, promise an interesting experience; like driving through a dam in
                        Idbar. We would surely miss the next thing that was on our list if this trip had happened a
                        decade ago. Yugoslavia's best kept secret. Before reaching Idbar we arrived to the city of
                        Konjic. Our windshield wipers were hard at work as we got caught in a downpour. The heavy
                        rain made it harder for us to find a sign with D-0 ARK written on it, which later led us to a
                        narrow road on the city's outskirts. Just as the clouds have cleared above us a military post
                        appeared in front of us where a guarding soldier mentioned that we should continue down
                        the road and park our cars next to the house, which seemed to be situated in the middle of
                        nowhere. The house is one of three secret entrances to an underground bunker called
                        facility D-0, otherwise known as the Army's reserve command or Tito's bunker. It was built
                        during the Cold War period and was intended as a sanctuary for Marshal Tito, his wife
                        Jovanka and for 350 others from Yugoslavia's supreme command thus enabling their
                        management over the armed forces up to six months of isolation in case of a nuclear attack.

                    <p>
                        As we were driving further towards the south on the E73 we were going further back into
                        Yugoslavia's history. The town of Jablanica got us to the year 1943. This is when World War
                        2 was writing history and at the time Yugoslavia was under Axis occupation. Fighting against
                        the occupation were the yugoslav Partisans with Tito as their leader. Jablanica marks a
                        stage for one of the most humane battles in history - The battle on the river Neretva also
                        known as The battle for the wounded. In the three month long battle the greatly
                        outnumbered Partisans suffered substantial losses and had a great deal of wounded
                        soldiers. Tito ordered that all the wounded must be saved but they found themselves in a
                        difficult situation as they got completely surrounded by enemy forces. It looked like there was
                        no way to escape but a solution to that was quickly devised. Tito ordered the demolition of all
                        the bridges crossing the river Neretva in the area. That convinced the german commanders
                        that the Partisans will not head eastwards over the river but towards the north and for that
                        reason ordered their forces to concentrate in that area. It was a tactical deception. 
                    </p>
                    <img id="" src={Jablanica} alt="" className="fl pa2 br4 w-20"/>
                    <p>
                        Right after the demolition of one of the bridges in Jablanica a
                        makeshift bridge was made on its ruins thus enabling the
                        22000 Partisans, 4000 of which were wounded, to cross
                        over Neretva and slip out of the deadly encirclement.
                        The wounded were saved. A walk around the local
                        museum gives you a more in-depth look of the events as
                        well as a look at the equipment and weapons used at the
                        time while overlooking the river with a rusty steel bridge
                        sticking out of it. Tito and his men retreated to an area in
                        eastern Bosnia that is today known as the Sutjeska
                        national park, where another major battle sparked after
                        the Axis caught up with them a month later. A decision to
                        follow history's footsteps got us driving eastwards on the
                        M6.1. The road was somewhere in good condition,
                        somewhere in a bit of a rough state and somewhere
                        completely absent where the occasional avalanche hid it
                        from our eyes. Most of the time we had the road just for
                        ourselves which was quite fun with its sweeping twists
                        and turns. Eventually it brought us into a valley where a
                        big sculpture appeared, visible from afar.
                    </p>
                    <img id="" src={Sutjeska} alt="" className="fr pa2 br4 w-40"/>
                    <p>
                        The Valley of heroes is a monument to all of those who lost their lives in the battle to escape
                        another encirclement. There were 127 000 Axis troops around the Partisans and 300 enemy
                        planes above them. In a month long battle they finally managed to break out and escape but
                        with a huge cost. For about a third of the initial Partisan force Sutjeska became their final
                        resting ground. The successful Partisan breakout helped their reputation as a viable fighting
                        force with the local populace. Consequently, they were able to replenish their losses with
                        new recruits, regroup, and mount a series of counterattacks in eastern Bosnia. The battle
                        marked a turning point toward Partisan control of Yugoslavia. They managed to liberate the
                        country from the Axis grasp in the next two years' time.
                        After the class of yugoslav history ended and a brief exploration of the wonderful city of
                        Mostar concluded we found ourselves rolling down our windows and sticking out our
                        passports as we reached the border crossing into Croatia at Metkoviči. An exciting moment
                        as it meant that soon we would reach the D8, a coastal tourist road known as the Adriatic
                        highway. It is simply put a great experience for nature lovers as well as passionate drivers
                        alike as every mile of it delivers breathtaking coastal panorama. Somewhere it takes you
                        high up the hills where you can admire the views of seemingly endless islands and
                        somewhere it takes you down to almost
                        sea level where you can witness the battle
                        between the waves and the coastal rocks.

                    <p>
                        It goes through calm, picturesque fishing
                        villages as well as through bustling major
                        seaside cities. It's a true delight, made
                        even sweeter if you happen to stumble
                        upon a beautiful empty beach where a
                        chance to cool off and rest a bit occurs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were passing one island after another. Slowly, my left arm was getting browner that my
                        right one which was hiding in the shade and mingling with the gear shifter. Eventually we
                        reached the city of Šibenik where the newly opened Beach Bar Mini is situated. What was
                        supposed to be a four to five
                        hour long drive, depending on
                        the highway traffic, ended up
                        being a 1200 mile, one week
                        long road trip. The day ended
                        with a barbecue on the
                        seaside where even Morris,
                        the bar's puppy mascot, took
                        a break from his job of
                        greeting visitors and enjoyed
                        a dish of grilled meat.

                        Reached home some 300 miles later in the evening of the next day. Moved the gear lever
                        into the reverse position and maneuvered the car slowly into the garage. In the meanwhile,
                        soundwaves were exiting through the tip of the exhaust system, bouncing from the garage
                        walls and were making their way to neighbouring houses. ˝They are probably used to it by
                        now,˝ I said to myself, but my guess is that they still don't like it, especially at 10 o'clock in
                        the evening.
